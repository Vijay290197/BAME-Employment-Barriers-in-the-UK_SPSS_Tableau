# Project Description <br/>

#### Race is one of the protected characteristics in the Equality Act (2010) and with Black Lives Matter protests dominating headlines, addressing issues around race, ethnicity and culture in the UK has become a necessity for the government. These issues are aligned to the structures of the British society, which continue to disadvantage Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME).

#### Learning Outcomes

On successful completion of this project, you will be able to: <br/>

	* Critically evaluate ethical and methodological considerations associated with applied secondary research,
